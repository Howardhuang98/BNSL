Bayesian network structure learning
===================================

**BLSN** (/Bai'sen/) is a Python library for data scientists, researchers that infers Bayesian network from observed data.
It puts **Dataframe** into predefined **Estimator**, and Estimator offers customized methods to find the Bayesian network structure.

If you are noobie in Bayesian network, don't hesitate to read the section :doc:`Bayesian network`. Then check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

   This project is under active development.
